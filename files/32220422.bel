replication, but also ACE2 is depleted from the cell membrane and \
therefore the damaging effects of Ang II are enhanced, resulting in \
acute deterioration of lung tissues [5]."

SET Evidence = "The angiotensin-converting 1 (ACE1) enzyme is characterized by a \
genetic deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism in intron 16, which is \
associated with alterations in circulating and tissue concentrations \
