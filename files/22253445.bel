SET Evidence = "FIGURE 7. Model of the PI kinases and PI4P involved in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. After SARS-CoV binds to ACE2, PI4P, the catalytic product of PI4KB, creates a lipid microenvironment or PI4P-enriched organelle required for the steps leading to fusion. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI4KB, such as LY294002 or wortmannin, suppress PI4KB activity and thereby inhibit SARSCoV S-mediated entry. Cellular factors, such as PI3Ks or Sac1, that negatively regulate PI4P generation can also inhibit SARS-CoV S-mediated entry."
